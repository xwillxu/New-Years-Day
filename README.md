## 2023: 🧨🎇🎆Fireworks, Sparklers, Lights, 2023🧨🎇🎆. Catergory: Firework Shows
### Great Firework Shows
I have currently seen a bunch of firework shows but, two really stick out to me.
1. The Sydney Firework Show: The show amazing from start to finish. There were hundreds of fireworks launched during the show. Thus making the show a amazing 
occurrence.
2. The Paris Firework Show: The show started like the average firework show. Then about 10 minutes later it hit a high note. The sky was lit up by at least two hundred
lights and fireworks. Making the end more spectacular than the Sydney Show.

### 2008 Bejing Olympics Fireworks VS 2023 New Year Firework Shows.
In the previous subtitle I talked about the greatest firework shows of the new year. Now I'm going to compare them with the 2008 Bejing Olympics Fireworks Show.
Just to give you a little background there are were two fireworks shows in 2008 opening ceremony. One at the start one at the end. We will call fireworks show number
one 2008 Initial Fireworks Show. We will call the other one 2008 Ending Fireworks Show.

Okay now lets start with Sydney: The Sydney Fireworks Show was more majestic and complexed than the 2008 Initial Fireworks Show. When compared with the 2008 Ending
Fireworks Show it would be somewhere in second or third. 2008 Ending Fireworks Show would be in first place. The real difference between them being the foot steps.

Now lets finish this blog post strong with Paris: Just like the Sydney Fireworks Show it more beautiful in it's entirety not just the beginning. Now if we compared the
end of the Paris Fireworks Show and the 2008 Ending Fireworks Show Paris won. But in the entirety of the Paris Fireworks Show it would lose just like Sydney but with a
lower chance of getting second place.

### When you can't think of anything else be like. LOL!
Sorry I can't make this post longer, it's because I can not think of anything else about fireworks. Though you may already know this because of the title. Next year I
will try to make it better so thhis will be one of my resolutions. HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR!
